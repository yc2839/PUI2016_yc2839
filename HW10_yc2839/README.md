This figure shows monthly rideship in terms of Local Spatial Autocorrelation, created by Dr. Sina Kashuk. The red areas are called hotspot due to high autocorrelation level, while the bule ones are called coldspot due to low autocorrelation to thier neighbors. From this figure, we can tell in which regions the rideship are affected by spatial autocorrelation (eg. Mid & lower Manhattan), which are not (eg. majority of Brooklyn), based on the colors. The light and dark changes in each color aslo indicates the strength of correlation.

These two figures show shouler season (summer season) and low (winter season) rideship in terms of Local Spatial Autocorrelation. In the light of both season figures are looking similary to each other, we can tell that little impact of season changes would bring to the autocorrelation pattern at whole regional level.
