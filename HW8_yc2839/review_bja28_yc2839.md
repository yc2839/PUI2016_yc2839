bja282 chose the citibike data to plot and focused on correlation between trip duration and population age. The plot was neat and straightforward as I can tell people between age 20 to 60 are the major bike users. The figure indicated people in age group 20 to 40 tend to have the higher trip duration than others. Finally, the plot itself did not miss any title or label and itâ€™s rather completed.
