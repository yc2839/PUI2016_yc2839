ms9548’s plot was about something really interesting! It dealt with Trump voters’ educational level, in terms of high school graduation rate (by state). If we only looked at the data points themselves, we might not realize anything between ‘Trump Support Percentage’ and Voters’ education level. But after the author added the OLS line, THEY were sort of inversely proportional to each other! This plot was informative.
