Assignment 1 
This is a long work as usual, download data in csv and zip formats, learn to how 'unzip' a file, clean up data, rename and merge columns, 
plot, do the chi suqare tests, I am still not familiar with the polynomial and how to plot the figure. 

Assignment 2 (worked with Kevin Han, Cheng Hou, Xiaomeng Dong
This is a group work, the figure and test was not the same as I did individually in the HW3, I did read the review from my peer. I just
did not get enough time to improve and present it in this homework though.
